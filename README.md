This is an  an aviation safety web application that monitors the pilot's biometrics through Bluetooth-connected wearable devices (like Fitbit watches) 
and compares them against safe ranges based on the pilot's age and weight,
all while functioning offline without requiring internet connectivity. 
The system operates through a mobile browser interface with a Python/Flask backend, 
providing real-time health alerts to pilots and safety personnel when biometric readings fall outside acceptable parameters.
